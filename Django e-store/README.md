# final-project
For my final project, I decided to create an E-Commerce website utilizing Django. I wanted to make the project as close to fully functional as possible. Customers can register/login and pick from various items to purchase. They can add these to a cart and have shipped to their address. We use Stripe functionality to accept payment. Site admins (Superusers) can go on and view orders, details, and mark orders as shipped at which point an email would be sent to the customer informing them of shipment. Customers that are confirmed purchasers of a product can post a review of an item while non-purchasers will have to purchase an item before being able to review. Superusers also have the ability to add new products to the site without visiting the admin site.
