Grading notes (if any)
----------------------
As of Nov 27, I have finished up to redirects. I'm still having issues with Pipe test 25 and need to work on CD and interrupts. I'm going to switch over to working on Pset 6 but hope to return to this if time permits at the end of the semester. 


Extra credit attempted (if any)
